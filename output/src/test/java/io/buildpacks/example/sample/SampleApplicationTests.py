 1. The `@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)` annotation indicates that the test class should use the SpringRunner test runner.
 2. The `@SpringBootTest` annotation indicates that the test class should start the entire Spring Boot application context for the test.
 3. The `@Test` annotation indicates that the `contextLoads()` method should be treated as a test method.
 4. The `contextLoads()` method is an empty test method that checks if the application context loads successfully.

Here's the Playwright test equivalent:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page, Playwright

def test_sample_application(page: Page, playwright: Playwright):
    page.goto("http://localhost:8080")
    assert page.url == "http://localhost:8080/"
    assert page.title() == "Sample Application"
```
